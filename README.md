## Installation

### Install using pip

You‚Äôll need to make sure you have pip available. You can check this by running:

```sh
pip --version
```

If you installed Python from source, with an installer from python.org, you should already have pip. If you‚Äôre on Linux and installed using your OS package manager, you may have to install pip separately.

> Haven‚Äôt installed pip? Visit: [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ ](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

Install the latest official release via pip. This is the best approach for most users. It will provide a stable version and are available for most platforms.

- Update pip to the latest stable version

```sh
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

- Install Nirjas

```sh
pip3 install nirjas
```

- Upgrading Nirjas

Upgrade already installed Nirjas library to the latest version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

```sh
pip3 install --upgrade Nirjas
```

### Install using source

If you are interested in contributing to [Nirjas](https://github.com/fossology/Nirjas) development, running the latest source code, or just like to build everything yourself, it is not difficult to install & build [Nirjas](https://github.com/fossology/Nirjas) from the source.

- Fork the [repo](https://github.com/fossology/Nirjas)

- Clone on your local system

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fossology/Nirjas.git
```

- Change directory

```sh
cd Nirjas/
```

- Install the package

```sh
pip3 install .
```

> This will install Nirjas on your system.

- Check if Nirjas is installed correctly or get help, Run:

  `nirjas -h` or `nirjas --help`

### Docker image

Nirjas also hosts Docker images on Docker hub. They can be pulled using

```sh
docker pull fossology/nirjas:latest
```

To scan with Docker image, just mount the directory you want to analyze and
pass the path as argument.

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/opt/ fossology/nirjas:latest /opt/<file_to_analyze>
```

## Example Usage

- For help

```sh
nirjas -h
```

- To extract comments from a single file

```sh
nirjas <path to file>
```

- To extract strings which assigned to variables from a source code file (Not yet implemented)

```sh
nirjas <path to source code file>
```

- To extract comments from all the files in directory/sub-directory

```sh
nirjas <path to directory>
```

- To extract only source code (excludes commented part) out of a file

```sh
nirjas -i <target file> <new file name including extension>
```

or for default file generation (default file: source.txt)

```sh
nirjas -i <target file>
```

## Tests

To run a test for Nirjas, execute the following script:

```sh
python3 testScript.py
```

This will download all the test files into `nirjas/languages/tests/TestFiles` folder and will run the tests as well.
